# iostreams-examples

These are the examples from 'Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales' by Angelika
Langer & Klaus Kreft. The source code was provided to Angelika Langer by Klaus
Wittlich of SAE IT-systems.

The terms of the source code provided is as follows:

```
Permission to use, copy, and modify this software for any non-profit purpose
is hereby granted without fee. Neither the author of this source code, Klaus
Wittlich, nor the authors of the above mentioned book, Angelika Langer and Klaus
Kreft, nor the publisher, Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., make any representations
about the suitability of this software for any purpose. It is provided "as is"
without express or implied warranty.
```

Beyond the initial commit of this repo are my own changes to use meson to build
the examples and to correct warnings and failures. My goal is to compile all the
examples on GCC 12.
