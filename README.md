# iostreams-examples

These are the examples from 'Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales' by Angelika
Langer & Klaus Kreft. The source code was provided to Angelika Langer by Klaus
Wittlich of SAE IT-systems.

This code was originally from [Angelika Langer's
website](http://www.angelikalanger.com/IOStreams/examples.htm).

Beyond the initial commit of this repo are my own changes to use meson to build
the examples and to correct warnings and failures. My goal is to compile all the
examples on GCC 12.
